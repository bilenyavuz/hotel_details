{"Code":"654405","Name":"Lykia Edrassa Hotel","Description":"I\u0027m at the concert of crickets and ducks. The conductor of the orchestra is the wave of the sea, the glistening of the creek in side flute elegance.\n\nOccasionally, the chorus of songs is accompanied by geese. One of the ducks who thinks that the geese come to the fore starts the solo. The concert of nature continues in harmony with the sound of the breeze coming from the mountain. I was so caught up in this beautiful fairy tale concert that I took myself to the top of the mountain. Then he takes it from the mountain and throws it into the sea, leaving me with the breeze of the wind. My body is the tree, my soul is dancing coy like the leaves of the tree. The peace of silence and the pleasure of meeting in the polyphonic nature orchestra\u2026\n\nIf you want to join this wonderful tale of nature, come to Lycia Edrassa!","Category":"BOUTIQUE","Chain":"","AccommodationType":"Boutique","Destination":"Antalya","District":"Cirali","Address":{"Street":"Adrasan Mah.241 sk.n:24 Kumluca, 241","PostCode":"7350","City":"OLYMPOS","CountryCode":"TR"},"Facilities":[{"Name":"Total number of rooms","IsFree":true},{"Name":"boutique hotel","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Disability-friendly bathroom","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Shower","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Wi-fi","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Internet access","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Wheelchair-accessible","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Smoking rooms","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Wheelchair-accessible","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Car park","IsFree":true},{"Name":"24-hour reception","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Check-in hour","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Check-out hour","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Wi-fi","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Car hire","IsFree":false},{"Name":"Transfer service","IsFree":false},{"Name":"Secure parking","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Smoke detector","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Hotel safe","IsFree":false},{"Name":"Shop","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Garden","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Terrace","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Partner\u2019s bike shop/workshop","IsFree":false},{"Name":"Sun terrace","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Luggage room","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Dining area","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Grill/BBQ","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Towels and bed linen","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Caf\u00E9","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Bar","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Restaurant","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Breakfast room","IsFree":true},{"Name":"TV lounge","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Breakfast","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Picnic","IsFree":true},{"Name":"Table tennis","IsFree":true}],"Images":[{"Description":"Restaurant","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_r_001.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_r_001.jpg"},{"Description":"Lobby","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_l_001.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_l_001.jpg"},{"Description":"Restaurant","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_r_002.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_r_002.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_001.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_001.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_002.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_002.jpg"},{"Description":"Bar","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ba_001.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ba_001.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_005.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_005.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_006.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_006.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_003.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_003.jpg"},{"Description":"General view","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_a_002.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_a_002.jpg"},{"Description":"Room","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_004.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_ro_004.jpg"},{"Description":"General view","ThumbnailUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/65/654405/654405a_hb_a_001.jpg","OriginalUrl":"https://photos.hotelbeds.com/giata/original/65/654405/654405a_hb_a_001.jpg"}],"Phones":[{"PhoneType":"PHONEBOOKING","PhoneNumber":"\u002B905323121662"},{"PhoneType":"PHONEHOTEL","PhoneNumber":"\u002B905323121662"},{"PhoneType":"FAXNUMBER","PhoneNumber":"\u002B902428831356"}]}
